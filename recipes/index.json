Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean. This toothpick test is important for most baking recipes. Take out the cupcakes and leave them to cool. To make the frosting, steam the chocolate (place it in a thermally resistent bowl over a pot of boiling water) until melted. In a bowl, add the butter, icing sugar, cocoa powder and milk and mix until you obtain a cream-like consistency. Incorporate the two cheeses to the mixture. When the chocolate has slightly cooled, add it to the frosting mixture. Add the frosting in spirals over each cupcake and add some grated chocolate.

Leave to rest, covered by a clean tea towel or cling film, for 30mins.

Keep the finished pierogi on a floured baking sheet and covered so they don\u0026rsquo;t dry out.  To cook the pierogi:\n Working in batches, put the pierogi in boiling water.
