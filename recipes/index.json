Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean. This toothpick test is important for most baking recipes. Take out the cupcakes and leave them to cool. To make the frosting, steam the chocolate (place it in a thermally resistent bowl over a pot of boiling water) until melted. In a bowl, add the butter, icing sugar, cocoa powder and milk and mix until you obtain a cream-like consistency. Incorporate the two cheeses to the mixture.

Leave to rest, covered by a clean tea towel or cling film, for 30mins.

Picking up one circle at a time, put in the filling — 1-2 teaspoons, depending on your confidence, fold the circle in half and crimp the edges shut. Repeat until all the pierogi are prepared. Keep the finished pierogi on a floured baking sheet and covered so they don\u0026rsquo;t dry out.  To cook the pierogi:\n Working in batches, put the pierogi in boiling water.
