      <description>This no-bake roll with biscuits and cocoa is a Romanian family favorite dessert! Inspired by this recipe with a couple of modifications.
Ingredients  200g butter biscuits (you can add more to taste - Leibniz type biscuits should work best) 50g cocoa powder 130g butter 100ml milk 125g sugar (either brown or white) 50g dark chocolate (at least 50% cocoa) rum essence (not necessary but it makes the taste much better - any Polish store should have it) vanilla sugar powdered sugar extra filling: nuts, almonds, raisins, cranberries, candied fruit, finely chopped Turkish delight, coconut flakes, or several of these!</description>
