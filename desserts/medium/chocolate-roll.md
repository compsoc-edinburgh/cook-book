# Chocolate roll

This no-bake roll with biscuits and cocoa is a Romanian family favorite dessert!
Inspired by [this recipe](https://www.lauraadamache.ro/2013/12/salam-de-biscuiti.html) with a couple of modifications.

Serves **an entire family**

## Ingredients

* 200g butter biscuits (you can add more to taste - Leibniz type biscuits should work best)
* 50g cocoa powder
* 130g butter
* 100ml milk
* 125g sugar (either brown or white)
* 50g dark chocolate (at least 50% cocoa)
* rum essence (not necessary but it makes the taste *much* better - any Polish store should have it)
* vanilla sugar
* powdered sugar
* *extra filling*: nuts, almonds, raisins, cranberries, candied fruit, finely chopped Turkish delight, coconut flakes, or several of these!

## Method

1. Melt the butter and chocolate on low heat until fully melted. Make sure not to melt the butter more than necessary. Let the mixture cool down.
2. Take 120g of biscuits and crush them until they turn into small crumbs (make sure they're small, as they make the roll stick together). 
3. Melt the sugar in 90ml milk and add it to the crushed biscuits.
4. Break up the rest of the biscuits into larger pieces and add them to the mix along with the cocoa powder, rum essence, and the butter-chocolate mixture (which should be cold).
5. Add a few teaspoons of cold milk and start mixing until homogenous. If you can make a little ball from the mix without it crumbling, it has a good consistency - if not, add more milk.
6. Sprinkle the powdered sugar on a board and start rolling the dough/mix on it, giving it a cylindrical, salami-like shape. Wrap in tin foil and make sure to twist the ends tight.
7. Leave in the fridge for a *minimum* of 3-4 hours, preferably over the night. The more you leave it, the better it will be cut when you open it.
8. Enjoy in 1.5 cm slices, not too thin!
