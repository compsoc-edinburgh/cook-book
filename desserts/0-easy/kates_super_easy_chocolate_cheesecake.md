# Kate's Super Easy Chocolate Cheesecake

Super easy and low-ingredient chocolate cheesecake recipe - extensively tested and produces a fabulously rich, dark cheesecake. If opting for a firmer, darker cheesecake, up the chocolate content to 600g (and you can even use darker chocolates, too!)
Serves 6-12. 

## Ingredients

### Biscuit Base
 - 150g digestive biscuits (~10)
 - 25-50g butter
 - 1tbsp caster sugar (optional)

### Cheesecake mixture
 - 300-600g dark chocolate (at least 50% cocoa powder)
 - 600g full fat cream cheese (note: does not have to be Philadelphia)
 - 20-30ml milk (semi-skimmed, optional)

## Method

### Base
1. Line a springform tin with baking paper. 
2. Blitz/crush the digestive biscuits, in a food processor or otherwise. 
3. Melt the butter e.g. in a microwave. Do not overheat it. 
4. Mix the digestive biscuits and the butter (in the springform tin or otherwise) and press flat with a spoon. 
5. Chill the base in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. 

### Cheesecake mixture
6. Prepare a pot of hot water and set a heat-resistant bowl in it, making sure the bowl does not make contact with the water (double-boiling). Set the heat to a medium heat initially. 
7. Once boiling, decrease the heat to a low heat, and break the chocolate into small pieces and melt in the bowl. 
8. **By hand,** mix in the cream cheese, milk, and any optional ingredients (e.g. Cointreau and orange zest for a slightly alcoholic chocolate orange cheesecake). 
9. This mixture may initially turn a lighter brown and create a swirling pattern (especially if a lower chocolate content is chosen), but this will turn to a smooth dark chocolate colour once this has been stirred by hand sufficiently. **These results do not appear if mixed by machine.**
10. Pour this mitxure into the biscuit base, levelling it out with a spoon. 
11. Freeze until set (around two hours) then refrigerate. Alternately, refrigerate for several hours (6h-overnight). 
12. Remove from tin and leave at room temperature for around 10 minutes before serving. 

## Storage instructions
Stores in the fridge for around a few days - do not prepare too long in advance.
