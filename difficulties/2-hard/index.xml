      <description>Dough Ingredients 0.5kg plain flour 1 large eggs 1 glass of lukewarm water 1 tbsp of oil Pinch of salt Method To make the dough:
Mix flour and salt in a bowl/on a kneading board (as for pasta). Make a well in the centre and add the eggs and oil into it. Mix together, slowly adding water, until it forms a smooth and non-sticky dough. Leave to rest, covered by a clean tea towel or cling film, for 30mins.</description>
