# Pierogi

## Dough 

### Ingredients

* 0.5kg plain flour
* 1 large eggs
* 1 glass of lukewarm water
* 1 tbsp of oil
* Pinch of salt

### Method

To make the dough:
1. Mix flour and salt in a bowl/on a kneading board (as for pasta).
2. Make a well in the centre and add the eggs and oil into it.
3. Mix together, slowly adding water, until it forms a smooth and non-sticky dough.
4. Leave to rest, covered by a clean tea towel or cling film, for 30mins.

To prepare the pierogi:
1. Split the dough in half; leave one half covered and roll out the second half on a well-floured surface. You want the dough to be fairly thin, around ~2-3mm of thickness.
2. Using the rim of a floured drinking glass, cut out circles in the rolled-out dough.
3. Picking up one circle at a time, put in the filling â€” 1-2 teaspoons, depending on your confidence, fold the circle in half and crimp the edges shut. 
4. Repeat until all the pierogi are prepared. Keep the finished pierogi on a floured baking sheet and covered so they don't dry out. 

To cook the pierogi: 
1. Working in batches, put the pierogi in boiling water. Reduce to a simmer, and cook for a few minutes; once they start rising to the surface, check for doneness. Remove with a slotted spoon once done.  

To serve:
The cooked pierogi can be eaten or reheated as they are - or you can pan-fry them in a bit of oil and serve them with some caramelized onions, fried bacon bits, and some sour cream. 

## Fillings
### Mushroom and sauerkraut
#### Ingredients

* 200g-400g sauerkraut, to taste
* One bag of dried mushrooms (~20g) or one box of fresh brown mushrooms (~200g) 
* (Optional) One bay leaf 
* Onions

#### Method

1. Soak the dried mushrooms in warm water for around 30 minutes. Drain most of the soaking liquid, reserving some for adding later. Chop roughly.  
2. Drain and rinse the sauerkraut, chop roughly. 
3. Add the sauerkraut and dried mushrooms (and optionally the bay leaf) to a pot. Cook for 30-40 minutes, adding liquid if needed, until the sauerkraut is cooked.
4. While the sauerkraut is cooking, fry the onions in a bit of oil, optionally caramelizing. If you are using fresh mushrooms, finely chop them and fry them in the same pot. 
5. Mix the sauerkraut and the onions together to make the filling. Remember to remove the bay leaf!
