# Lamb Koftas

## Ingredients

* 500g lamb mince
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* Chilli flakes, to taste
* 2 tbsp chopped parsley leaves
* 2 tbsp chopped mint leaves
* Salt
* Pepper

## Method

1. Mix together all ingredients until well blended.
2. Roll the lamb mixture into pieces the size of golf balls and flatten them into patties about 1
   cm thick. Place on a plate drizzled with a little olive oil, and drizzle the tops of the patties
   with more oil, ready for cooking. Cover and chill for about 10 minutes to firm up.
3. Cook on a griddle or in a frying pan at a medium-high heat until both sides are well browned.
4. Serve with pitta bread and houmous (tzatziki and chilli sauce also work well).
