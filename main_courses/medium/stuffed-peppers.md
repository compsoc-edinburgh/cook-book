Adapted from [this recipe](https://www.lalena.ro/u/reteta/902/Ardei-umpluti-cu-ciuperci/) with slight alterations - check it out if you need visuals.

Serves **8-11**

## Ingredients

* 11 peppers (I tend to use red or yellow)
* 3 brown onions
* 2 carrots
* 300g Champignon mushrooms (any of the smaller mushrooms varieties should do)
* 200g rice (risotto or generally white rice)
* 1 bunch of fresh dill
* 1 can chopped tomatoes
* 1 tbsp dry thyme
* 60ml oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 2 vegetable stock cubes

## Method

1. Wash the vegetables. Finely chop the onions and grate the carrots.
2. Add oil to the pan along with the onions and the carrots, fry for 7-8 minutes.
3. Finely chop the mushrooms.
4. Add the rice and 100ml water to the pan with the onions and carrots.
5. Add thyme and a bit of salt to the pan and let it cook for another 10 minutes.
6. Prepare the peppers for stuffing. Depending on their size and how much you want to stuff them, you will need anywhere from 8 to 11 of them.
7. In a larger bowl, mix the cooked vegetables and the mushrooms with finely chopped dill and salt/pepper to your taste. Stuff the peppers with the mix.
8. Boil around 200ml of water and add the stock cubes. Place on a baking tray with the chopped tomatoes.
9. Add the stuffed peppers to the tray and cook until well roasted.

Enjoy!
