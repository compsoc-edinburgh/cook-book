# Steak Pie

## Ingredients

* 900g stewing/braising steak, cut into cubes
* 25g plain flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 onions, sliced
* 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
* 1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme
* 850ml / 1.5 pints hot beef stock
* 225g ready-rolled shortcrust pastry
* 1 egg, beaten

## Method

1. Roll the cubed steak in the seasoned flour until well coated.
2. Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed frying bowl and fry the meat, stirring frequently, until
   browned on all sides.
3. Add the sliced onion, herbs, salt and pepper and the stock and bring to the boil.
4. Reduce the heat and simmer for an hour and a half.
5. Preheat the oven to 190C fan.
6. Transfer the filling to an ovenproof dish. Line the rim of the dish with a thin strip of pastry.
   Dampen the pastry rim by brushing with beaten egg. Cut a piece of pastry to fit across the top
   of the dish and place on top of the dish, pressing the edges together to seal. Decorate with
   pastry trimmings, **make a steam hole in the centre of the pie by slashing with a sharp knife**,
   then brush with more beaten egg.
7. Put the pie in the oven and cook for 1 hour.
8. Serve with chips and mushy peas/baked beans for the true experience.
