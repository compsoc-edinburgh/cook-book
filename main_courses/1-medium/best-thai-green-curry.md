# Thai Green Curry

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp Thai green curry paste (adjust for spice tolerance)
* 1 tbsp soft dark brown sugar
* 1-2 thick stalks lemongrass, fat ends bashed with a rolling pin (optional)
* 750g chicken, cut into chunks
* 6-8 kaffir lime leaves, torn into pieces
* 400ml coconut milk (have a spare in case you need to take the spice out)
* Good shake of Thai fish sauce or light soy sauce
* Small handful of coriander, roughly chopped
* 1/2 - 1 lime, juice only

## Method

1. Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan. Add the green curry paste and sugar and cook over a
   fairly high heat for about a minute, stirring with the lemongrass, if using.
2. Reduce the heat slightly and stir in the chicken pieces and lime leaves or zest until coated in
   the paste.
3. Add the coconut milk, lemongrass, fish sauce or soy sauce and bring to a simmer, cooking for
   25-30 minutes until thickened slightly. Veg may be added now, such as spinach, green peppers,
   green beans or sugar snaps.
4. Stir in the coriander and lime juice. Check for seasoning, adding more fish sauce or soy sauce
   or lime if needed. Add more coconut milk if the curry is too spicy.
2. Leave curry to sit for ~10 minutes to come to. Serve with jasmine rice.
