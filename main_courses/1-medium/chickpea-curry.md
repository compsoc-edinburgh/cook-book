* 150g red lentils, rinsed
* 2 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp cumin seeds

## Method

1. Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat, add the onion, garlic and green
   pepper and fry gently for 10-12 minutes or until softened and beginning to colour.
2. Stir in the lentils and spices and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the tomato
