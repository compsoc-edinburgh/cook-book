# Chicken and Lentil Dahl

## Ingredients

* 215g red lentils
* 500g chicken breasts, cut in half
* 3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 3 teaspoons cumin seeds
* 5 black cardamom pods or 10 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 small onion, thinly sliced
* 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 2-6 green chillies, chopped (based on preference)

## Method

1. Place the lentils, chicken, salt, turmeric, fresh ginger, ground ginger, 2 teaspoons of the
   cumin seeds and the cardamom pods in a deep saucepan. Pour in 900ml boiling water and return the
   water to a gentle simmer. Cook, uncovered, for 40 minutes, remembering to stir frequently to
   avoid sticking. If the lentils thicken too much, you may need to add a little more boiling
   water. At the end of the cooking time, the lentils should resemble a pulp and have a consistency
   similar to that of a thick pumpkin soup.
2. In the meantime, pour the olive oil into a frying pan, add the remaining cumin seeds and cook
   over a low-medium heat until the seeds start to pop - this should take no longer than 2-3
   minutes.
3. Add the onions and fry until light brown in colour, remembering to stir frequently - this should
   take no more than 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and chillies and fry for about 2-4 minutes or
   until the garlic is a golden brown colour.
4. Once the lentils are ready, stir the spice mixture into the lentil mixture and simmer for just a
   few minutes.

**_Note: Make sure you don't eat the cardamom pods! They hurt, I tell you this from experience._**
