# Gorgonzola risotto with sun dried tomatoes

## Ingredients

* 1.2L stock (chicken or veg)
* 240ml dry white wine (e.g. Pinot Grigio)
* 300g risotto rice
* 280g jar of sun dried tomatoes in oil, chopped (slow roasted tomatoes also work)
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 250g Gorgonzola, chopped into small pieces
* 25g butter
* Fresh basil for dressing

## Method

1. Heat the stock in a saucepan over a low heat so it’s simmering gently
2. Chop up the onion and the tomatoes. Top tip: chop the tomatoes in the jar with a pair of sharp scissors.
3. In a large saucepan, fry the onion, garlic and tomatoes in the tomato’s oil over a medium heat until soft.
4. Add the rice and stir thoroughly so the rice is coated in the oil.
5. Add the wine and sir until absorbed and the sauce has started to thicken.
6. Reduce the heat slightly and add a ladle of hot stock, stir the risotto constantly until the stock absorbs and you can drag the spoon through the risotto leaving a trail behind it. Continue adding single ladles of stock in this way until the stock is finished. About 20-25 minutes.
7. Season to taste, then add the butter, stirring to incorporate. Add the Gorgonzola and stir to melt and combine. Serve immediately, optionally with basil for decoration.
