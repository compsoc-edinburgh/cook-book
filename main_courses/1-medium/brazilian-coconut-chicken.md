# Brazilian Coconut Chicken

## Ingredients

* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 4 chicken breasts, chopped into cubes
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 tbsp minced fresh ginger
* 2 green chillies, seeded and chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
* 1 (400ml) tin light coconut milk

## Method

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the spices and place the chicken in, seasoning with salt and
   pepper.
2. Rub the chicken all over with the spice mix until it has an even coating. (May have to do in
   batches.)
3. Heat some olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat and place the chicken in the frying pan.
   Cook 10-15 minutes each side until cooked. Remove and set aside. Chop into hearty chunks.
4. Add more oil to the frying pan and cook the onions, ginger, garlic and chilli for 5 minutes or
   until tender. Mix in the tomatoes and continue cooking. Stir in the coconut milk and simmer for
   5 minutes, adding the chicken in at the end to heat through.
5. Serve over fragrant, spiced rice.
