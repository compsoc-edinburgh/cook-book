## Ingredients

* 3 tbsp harissa
* 3 tbsp low-fat natural yogurt
* 4 skinless chicken breasts, slashed
* 1 small butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and cut into wedges
* 2 red onions, cut into wedges

_(Other vegetables also work, such as shallots, sweet potato(!), peppers, etc)_

## Method

1. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan. Mix 2 tbsp of harissa with the yogurt and rub all over the chicken
   breasts and set aside to marinate while you start the veg. Preferably for a few hours
   beforehand, but can be for 20-30 mins at least.
2. Toss the vegetables with remaining harissa, mixed with 2 tbsp of oil and some seasoning in a
   large roasting tin. Roast for 20 minutes.
3. Remove veg from the oven, add the chicken to the tin, then roast for a further 20-25 minutes
   until the chicken and veg are cooked through.

_Serving suggestion_: Serve with fried or roasted potatoes.
