# Pork & Pistachio Meatloaf

## Ingredients

* 100g white breadcrumbs
* 150g pistachio nuts, roughly chopped
* 1kg pork mince
* 50g pickled gherkins, chopped into pieces
* 1 tbsp English mustard
* 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
* 2 medium free range eggs, beaten
* Salt and pepper

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180C fan. Line the base of a 900g non-stick loaf tin with grease proof
   paper.
2. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Get your hands involved to really squidge
   everything together. Season heartily.
3. Pack down the mixture into the loaf tin as best you can and bake in the oven for 35 minutes,
   until the loaf is fine to the touch. Allow it to 'come to' for about 10 minutes before turning
   it out. Leave to cool, then slice and serve.

_Serving suggestion_: Serve with (mustard) mashed potatoes and carrots.
