# Sausage Casserole

## Ingredients

* 12 sausages
* 6 rashers rindless streaky bacon, cut into 2.5cm/1in lengths
* 2 medium onions, thinly sliced
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 tsp hot chilli powder or smoked paprika
* 400g tin chopped tomatoes
* 300ml chicken stock
* 2 tbsp tomato purée
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tbsp dark brown muscovado sugar
* 1 tsp dried mixed herbs
* 2 bay leaves
* 3–4 sprigs of fresh thyme
* 100ml red or white wine (optional, but encouraged)
* 400g tin butter beans or mixed beans
* salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method

1. Heat a tablespoon of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and fry the sausages gently for 10
   minutes, turning every now and then until nicely browned all over. Transfer to a large saucepan
   or a flameproof casserole dish and set aside.
2. Fry the bacon pieces in the frying pan until they begin to brown and crisp then add to the
   sausages.
3. Place the onions in the frying pan and fry over a medium heat for five minutes until they start
   to soften, stirring often. You should have enough fat in the pan, but if not, add a little more
   oil.
4. Add the garlic and cook for 2–3 minutes more until the onions turn pale golden-brown, stirring
   frequently.
5. Sprinkle over the chilli powder or smoked paprika and cook together for a few seconds longer.
6. Stir in the tomatoes, chicken stock, tomato purée, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and herbs.
7. Pour over the wine, or some water if you’re not using wine, and bring to a simmer.
8. Tip carefully into the pan with the sausages and bacon and return to a simmer, then reduce the
   heat, cover the pan loosely with a lid and leave to simmer very gently for 20 minutes, stirring
   from time to time.
9. Drain the beans and rinse them in a sieve under cold running water. Stir the beans into the
   casserole, and continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick.
10. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve with rice or slices of
    rustic bread.
