# Sausage, Apple and Leek Pie

## Ingredients

* 8 sausages
* 1 apple, peeled and sliced into small bits
* 3 leeks, sliced (depending on size)
* 1 tbsp plain flour
* 1 tbsp grainy mustard
* 300ml stock
* 375g ready-rolled shortcut pastry
* 1 egg, beaten

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 200C/Fan 180C. Fry sausages in large frying pan until brown on all sides. Remove from
   the frying pan and set to one side.
2. Fry the leeks for 8-10 minutes until softened, then add the apple and fry for 1 minute.
3. Stir in the flour, followed by the mustard. Pour over the stock and bubble for 2 minutes to make
   a gravy.
4. Chop the sausages into chunks and stir into the pan. Then tip everything into a large ovenproof
   dish.
5. Top with the pastry, trimming off the excess and glazing with the egg.
6. Bake for 25 minutes until golden.

_Note: You may wish to add more apple, depending on your preference. I reckon it could do with 1
and a half apples._
