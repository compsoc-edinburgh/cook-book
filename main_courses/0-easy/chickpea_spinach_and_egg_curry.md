# Chickpea, spinach and egg curry

## Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 2 tsp cumin seeds
* 1 tsp black mustard seeds
* 2 tbsp medium curry powder
* 1 tsp garlic granules
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 400g tin chopped tomatoes
* 400g tin chickpeas, drained & rinsed
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 100ml boiling water
* 180g baby spinach leaves
* Fresh coriander, to garnish

## Method

1. Boil the eggs for 6-8 minutes. Shock in an ice bath once done to make peeling easier.
2. Meanwhile, heat some oil in a wide frying pan over a low heat. Add the cumin, black mustard seeds, curry powder, garlic granules and ground ginger and stir-fry for 1 minute.
3. Add the tomatoes, chickpeas, lemon juice and boiling water and season. Cook over a high heat for 6-8 minutes, or until reduced and thickened, stirring often. Add the spinach and cook until wilted.
4. Divide the curry between 2 bowls, top each with a halved hard boiled egg and sprinkle over some curry powder. Scatter with coriander and serve.
