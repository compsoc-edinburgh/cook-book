# Turkish Eggs / Shakshuka

## Ingredients

* 2 small onion
* 4 eggs
* 1 tin chopped tomatoes
* 1 red pepper, deseeded and sliced
* 1-2 red chillies, deseeded and sliced
* 1-2 tsp caster sugar
* 2 sprigs thyme
* 1.5 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tbsp parsley, roughly chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 6 tbsp thick, creamy yogurt

## Method

1. Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan. Stir in the onions, pepper and chillies. Cook until
   they begin to soften. Add the tomatoes and sugar, mixing well. Cook until the liquid has
   reduced, season. If lacking a bit of oomph, add a tbsp of soy sauce.
2. Using a wooden spoon, create 4 pockets in the tomato mixture and crack the eggs into them. Cover
   the pan and cook the eggs over a low heat until just set.
3. Beat the yogurt with the garlic and season. Sprinkle the eggs with parsley and serve on toast
   with a dollop of garlic yogurt.
