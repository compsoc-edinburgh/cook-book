# Chorizo Linguine

## Ingredients

* 2 peopleâ€™s worth linguine, ~120g?
* 1/3 ring of chorizo, cut into thick quarter moons
* Juice of half a large lemon
* Handful fresh parsley, around 6 stems, plucked and finely chopped

## Method

1. Bring a pot of heavily salted water to the boil and add the pasta, cooking until al-dente (roughly 8 minutes)
2. Meanwhile in a large frying pan, fry the chorizo in a small bit of olive oil until it gives up its oil and becomes crispy
3. Lower the heat and add the capers and fry for a minute, stirring frequently.
4. Drain the pasta, reserving about about 100ml of cooking water. Add the drained pasta and about half of the water to the frying pan. Mix well with the chorzo and capers until well combined.
5. Sprinkle the cheese over the top, followed by the lemon juice and parsley. Mix well until the cheese is melted and the sauce has thickened slightly. Serve immediatelyi
