# Instant Pot Spaghetti & Meat Sauce

Super duper easy recipe for spaghetti & meat sauce that you can do right in an instant pot.

## Ingredients

 - 8 oz dry pasta (spaghetti works best)
 - 1 tbsp olive oil
 - 500g ground beef
 - Small onion
 - 475ml water
 - 24oz tomato sauce (1 jar, or equiv. homemade)
 - Garlic powder
 - Onion powder
 - Kosher salt
 - Pepper
 - Red pepper flakes
 - Grated parmesan (for serving)

## Method

1. Set your instant pot to Sauté, and once it's hot add the olive oil and minced onion.
   Sauté until the onion starts to turn translucent.
2. Add the beef, seasoning with garlic & onion powder and salt & pepper to taste. Sauté until
   browned.
3. Shut off the instant pot. and add ~150ml of the water. Scrape the bottom of the pot, ensuring
   all the fond is scraped off (otherwise the instant pot will burn and shut off).
4. Add the sauce, and stir the pot to combine.
5. Break your pasta in half and layer it on top of the meaty tomato-y mess you have created.
   __Do not stir from this point on!__
6. If you used jarred tomato sauce, rinse off the jar with the rest of the water and pour it into
   the pot. Otherwise, just pour the water into the pasta.
7. Set the Instant Pot on High for 8min.
8. Quick release the pressure when completed.
9. Serve with ricotta and/or parmesan, to taste.

_Note that for other types of pasta such as penne, you may need to use more water. I've found that about a 3/4 cup extra works well._
