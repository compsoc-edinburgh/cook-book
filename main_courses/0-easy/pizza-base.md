# Fool-proof Pizza Base

Your friends and family are going to ask you whether Gordon Ramsay assisted.

As seen on https://github.com/elenalape/pizza

## Ingredients:

- 1 large cup/2 normal cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 1 tsp dry yeast
- 0.75 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- **Optional: garlic powder**

## Method:

1. Add a small amount of warm (not hot, you'll kill the yeast!) water into a mug and mix with yeast and sugar until both dissolve. Leave it to sit for 5 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, mix flour, salt and optionally, garlic powder. Pour in the yeasty water.
3. Now take your hands and do that thing you see in movies when they are making bread.
If the dough is too sticky, add some flour. If it's too stiff, add some more warm water.
4. When it gets to soft play dough consistency, rub some olive oil in.
5. Place your pizza dough in a large bowl or pot, cover with a cloth and place someplace warm (not hot!). Leave it to rise for about an hour.
6. Once the dough has risen, shape your pizza base using something cylindrical. Raid your dad's wine cellar.

Add toppings and bake in 220C oven for around 15 minutes. Could be less or more, depending on how thick or thin your base is. When you'll know, you'll know.
