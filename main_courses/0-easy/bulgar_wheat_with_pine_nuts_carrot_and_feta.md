# Bulgar Wheat with Pine Nuts, Carrot and Feta

## Ingredients

* 300g bulgur wheat
* 70g sultanas
* 500ml hot vegetable/chicken stock
* 2 medium carrots, coarsely grated
* 3 tbsp pine nuts
* 100g feta, crumbled (about half a packet)
* juice & zest 1/2 lemon
* 3 tbsp rapeseed/olive oil

## Method

1. Put the bulgur and sultanas in a large bowl and pour over the hot stock.
   Cover with cling film and leave for 20-30 mins for the liquid to be

3. Add all the other ingredients to the bulgur wheat. Mix well and season.
